# Hi there I'm Erik. :wave:

### I'm a Front End Developer everyday looking to improve my whole understanding of software development.

To reach this goal I've created some repos where I keep track of all the topics, progress and projects for the specific field I'm currently studing.

### [Rust](https://www.google.com)
I've always wanted to learn a system programming language so I've decided to deep dive into [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

### [React](https://github.com/erik18xk) NRY.
Even though I know React :smiley: there are some concepts of the framework I still need to master. Eg: (Reconciliation, performance optimizations and so on). If you are interested check the repo.

### [FE Architecture](https://github.com/erik18xk) NRY.
In this repo I'll try to better understand the tools and processes that aim to improve the quality of frontend applications. Eg: (micro frontends, module federation ...)

### [Cloud and Serverless](https://github.com/erik18xk) NRY.
In this section I'll keep track of my progress in the open source cloud world. Eg: (FaaS, K8s, Kafka, Apache OpenWisk, Nginx)

<br />

Every page is/will be documented with all the resources I've used to improve my understanding and for every topic I'm planning to build real world projects.

Hope someone will find this idea helpfull. 

Thanks, </br>

Erik.
