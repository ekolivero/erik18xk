# Hi there I'm Erik. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front end developer, but in my free-time I love __challenging my self__ in many disparate areas like backend development and devops solutions.


## The Rust  Journey
Beeing a javascript developer I felt the need to imporve my skills in at least one general purpose language. The final choice has been [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

So I've decided to keep track of my progress in a dedicated [repository](https://github.com/erik18xk/road-to-rust).

The final __goal__ is to be able to _contribute_ the awesome projects that are pushing the javascript ecosystem.

If you are looking for someone for learn rust with please send me and email at <ekolivero@pm.me> ðŸ˜Š

Have a great day. 

Erik.
